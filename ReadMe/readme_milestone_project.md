Milestone Project-1: User-Centric Fronted Development - Code Institute

For this first Milestone Project, the goal was to develop a frontend-only website for the famous band: "The Monkees". 
The primary goal is to make the website accessible for the fans that wish to use the website to see
and hear the videos and clips of the band. In addition to that, 
the band wants a feature to publicize their availability to perform at events.
 
The project consists of 4 separate pages that cover the home page (the first page), about page (page about the artists of the band),
music page (the music portfolio), and booking page (the booking form).
